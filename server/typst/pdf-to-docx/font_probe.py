"""Show that Word sets the Word file in the fonts the file carries.

    <venv>/python -I -B font_probe.py <scratch-folder>

A developer tool, like `compare.ps1`. It is not part of `bun run test`, it
never runs in Docker, and it needs typst on PATH, Microsoft Word, and
`pdffonts` (MiKTeX ships one).

The thing it exists to answer cannot be answered with a real report: this
machine has the report's text font installed, so a Word file that named its
fonts wrongly still came out looking right, and the one font the machine did
not have was the one that came out in Verdana. Installing and uninstalling
fonts to find out is not something a test may do to the machine it runs on.

So the fonts are made instead. Two permissively licensed families from
`public/fonts/` are copied and their name tables rewritten to families nobody
can have installed: `Btct Probe Sans` with all four of Word's faces, `Btct
Probe Sans SemiBold` as a family of its own to exercise the weight Word does
not keep per family, and `Btct Probe Mono`. A one-page report is set in them,
compiled with `--ignore-system-fonts`, converted, rendered back to PDF
through Word, and read with `pdffonts`. Every font in that list must be a
probe family. Word cannot have found one anywhere but inside the file.

Word renames a font it loaded from a document to `___WRD_EMBED_SUB_n` when it
writes a PDF, which is itself the proof: a name like that is a face that came
out of the file rather than off the machine. The face behind it is identified
by its PostScript name, which Word leaves alone.

A fourth family, `Btct Probe Serif`, is the control. It is the same report in
a font whose outlines are PostScript rather than TrueType, which Word will
not carry however correctly the file declares it. The converter refuses that
one with a warning, and the probe expects Word to substitute for it: it is
here so the difference between a font Word cannot use and a font this change
fixed stays visible rather than becoming a story.

Licences. DejaVu Sans Mono is Bitstream Vera plus public-domain changes; the
Vera licence allows modification and forbids the modified font from carrying
`Bitstream` or `Vera` in its name, which none of these do. Libertinus Serif,
the control, is SIL OFL 1.1, which allows modification and requires the name
to change when it does, which is what this is. Both keep their copyright and
licence name records.

This paragraph is set in the regular face of the probe family, and it runs on
for long enough that a substituted font would break the line somewhere else
than this one does. Here is *a run in bold*, here is _a run in italic_, and
here is *_a run in bold italic_*, so all four of the faces Word keeps under
one family name are asked for on the same page.

#text(weight: "semibold", size: 13pt)[A second semibold line]

The semibold face above is a family of its own as far as Word is concerned.
Word keeps four faces per family and semibold is not one of them, so a file
that asked for the family below it with the bold bit set would be asking for
a different face and getting a painted-on weight over the top of it.
