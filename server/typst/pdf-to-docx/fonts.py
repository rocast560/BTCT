"""Carry the report's fonts into the Word file, so it reads the same anywhere.

A Word file names its fonts and expects the reader's machine to have them.
This one is made from a PDF and, since the owner asked for the PDF's line
endings to be reproduced exactly, a substituted font does not merely look
different: a line that fitted the column becomes one that does not, and the
page re-wraps. So the fonts go in the file.

**Word looks a font up by the name in its own name table, and by nothing
else.** A PDF names a font by its PostScript name, `DejaVuSansMono` or
`Poppins-SemiBold`, and that is not the name Word asks for. Word asks for
name ID 1, the legacy family (`DejaVu Sans Mono`, `Poppins SemiBold`), plus
the bold and italic bits, which the font states in name ID 2. A face declared
under its PostScript name is a face Word never finds, embedded or not, and it
substitutes in silence. So every name written into the document comes from
the font file's own tables: `w:rFonts` on the run, `w:font w:name` in the
table, and the four embed slots under it.

Name ID 2 only ever says Regular, Bold, Italic or Bold Italic, because those
four are all Word keeps per family. A weight outside them, SemiBold say, is a
family of its own: name ID 1 is `Poppins SemiBold` and name ID 2 is
`Regular`. Asking for `Poppins` with the bold bit on gets a different face
with a fake weight painted over it, so that record is read whole rather than
searched: `SemiBold` is not `Bold`, and `BoldItalic` is both. See `style_of`,
where each of those was a bug before it was a rule.

The embedding format is awkward but small. Each font is a part under
`word/fonts/` whose first 32 bytes are XORed with a key taken from the part's
own GUID, the relationship from `word/fontTable.xml` names it under
`w:embedRegular` and friends with that GUID as `w:fontKey`, and
`word/settings.xml` has to say `w:embedTrueTypeFonts`. `w:saveSubsetFonts` is
deliberately left off: the whole font goes in, so the file stays editable
rather than carrying only the glyphs this report happened to use. For the
same reason a family that the report uses at all is carried whole, up to its
four slots, rather than only in the faces the report set text in.

**The font is read before it is carried.** fontTools opens a file and
decompiles a table only when one is asked for, so a font truncated to a third
of itself answers every question about its name and its licence and fails only
when a reader asks it to draw something. So the tables a usable font needs are
required by name and one real outline is decompiled; a file that cannot manage
that is skipped as damaged. The bytes are bounded too, at 15 MB for one face
and 40 MB for the file, because the export as a whole is capped at 100 MB.

**Word carries TrueType outlines and nothing else.** A font whose outlines
are PostScript, the `.otf` flavour, can be written into the package and
declared in the table and Word will still substitute. That is measured, not
assumed: `font_probe.py` made one probe family of each kind out of the same
report, and Word's render came back with the TrueType family and with Calibri
where the other one should have been. It is not a rare case either, because
typst's own default font is one of them, so such a face is **redrawn** on the
way in: every cubic curve is approximated by a quadratic within a thousandth
of an em, and everything a line's width depends on, the advance widths, the
vertical metrics, the kerning and the shaping tables, is left exactly as it
was. Only the side bearings move, and only to the redrawn outline's own left
edge. See `to_truetype`.

**Licences are read, not assumed.** The OS/2 table's `fsType` says what the
foundry allows. 0 is installable, 8 is editable, 4 is preview and print, and
2 is restricted. The first two are embedded and the other two are skipped and
named in a warning, so whoever sends the file knows a reader without the font
will see something else. Preview and print is refused for a reason of its
own: Word honours that bit by opening the document read-only, which takes
away the one thing this export is for.

Redrawing the outlines is a modification, which is a second question and gets
a second answer: the licence name records are read too, and a face is only
redrawn under a licence that is recognised here as allowing it. An
unrecognised licence is refused and named rather than guessed at. The
embedded copy keeps the family name it came with, because that name is the
only thing Word matches on, so this is not a renamed derivative anybody
receives as a font: it is the same face inside one document.
